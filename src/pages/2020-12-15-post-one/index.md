<h2>Creating a Gatsby blog from scratch</h2>
<p>
Welcome to Gatsby (or GatbyJS), a powerful framework for static site generation that leverages GraphQL and React. Gatsby’s popularity increases as time goes on, and more and more people are starting to use it. One of the reasons for this is its ability to help you create a simple static website straightforward and quickly.

You just whip out one of their Starter Kits, set up an account on Netlify, and boom, you have a website.

I also used to set up websites that way. I saw an opportunity to create a blog instantly without much fuss and went for it. But a problem occurred later when I tried to add some complex logic to my blog. I didn’t really understand what was going on behind the scenes. What is Gatsby doing, and why does it seem so magical? For that reason, I decided to take a step back and build a Gatsby blog from scratch.

In this post, I will share how to build a blog from a simple Gatsby starter kit and explain how Gatsby works behind the scenes. The post should bring clarity into how this opinionated framework for building static sites ticks, and how you can customize it to fit your needs.
