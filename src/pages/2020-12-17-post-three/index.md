<p>With this plugin, attributes you add in their component, e.g. title, meta attributes, etc. will get added to the static HTML pages Gatsby builds.

This is important not just for site viewers, but also for SEO â€” title and description metadata stored in the document head is a key component used by Google in determining placement in search results.</p>
